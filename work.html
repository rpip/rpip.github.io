        I'm available to help with any type of project - software, brick-and-mortar operations, and everything in between. I can help you to specify your problem and solve this in the most cost-effective way. If this involves developing custom software, I can select the right technologies, and design and implement the solution.

    <ul class="services">
        <li class="service"> <h3 class="service__title">Rapid Development:</h3> <p class="service__description">My experience have been quite different from each other so far in terms of technology stacks as well as company culture, size and field of business. This has helped me develop a broad set of skills and a good view on how things should and should not be done in different contexts. If you’re just starting out or you’ve got a project that's a little out of control, I can help you get it back on track. </p></li>

        <li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Performance:</h3> <p class="service__description">I can do a full overhaul of your software and systems to tune-up the performance and reduce costs, by redesigning algorithms and tools for efficiency and improve the performance.</p> </li>

        <li class="service"> <h3 class="service__title">Scalability:</h3> <p class="service__description">Want advice on moving to a service oriented architecture? Considering refactoring a large, legacy codebase? Or maybe looking at switching database and looking for a second opinion, and help with the migration? I can help. </p></li>

        <li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Data Science and Blockchain:</h3> <p class="service__description">I can extract knowledge, build systems, and automate processes. Different blockchains require different approaches; I figure them all out and abstract out their complexities so that you don't need to.</p> </li>

        <li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Content/research development:</h3><p class="service__description">I enjoy doing business teardowns and market analysis; always ready to dive into research to produce understandable interfaces and creative solutions.</p> </li>
